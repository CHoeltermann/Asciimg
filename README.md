A little exercise in python that allows the user to convert an image into ASCII art.
I am still working on it and it does not yet work properly.

## TO DO

* row length varies. I need to find out why and correct it.
* find out if there is a faster way to iterate over the pixels
* Find out why the scale factor doesn't work
